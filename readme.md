# API access

## REST API

Our REST API provides a simple and secure way to obtain quotes and K-line data for various products. The REST API can publicly access endpoints through market data endpoints, which require signatures for requests.

## Websocket API

Use asynchronous methods (publish/subscribe) to efficiently push notifications of orders, transactions, markets, and other related information. By subscribing to specific topics of interest, users can receive real-time updates without constant polling.

## FIX API

iTick FIX Connection is an industry-standard solution that helps our institutional clients take full advantage of our high-availability system. It is specifically designed to handle large throughput and supports end-to-end access to our rich liquidity information.
